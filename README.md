# NYC-Restaurant-Week
Provides a script to pair NYC restaurant week restaurants with Yelp reviews

Note that the results from running the script are included in data.csv
There is no need to pound Yelp's server for no reason.

Right now, this script fails to pull in a large number of restaurants, largely because it struggles to find that resturant on Yelp. There is a lot we could do to mitigate this issue if anyone wants me to. Right now, I still find the script useful in it's current form.
